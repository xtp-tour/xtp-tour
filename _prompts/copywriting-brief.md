## Tone & Style Guidelines

**Voice:** Humble yet witty, with a light touch of irony

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Clear and concise:** Simple language that all tennis players understand
- **Lightly ironic and playful:** The name "XTP Tour" playfully references professional tours - amateurs get to feel like pros on their own "tour" (do not mention ATP Tour directly)
- **Humble and relatable:** Avoid hype or exaggeration; genuine tone that resonates with real tennis enthusiasts
- **Benefit-focused:** Emphasize how the app simplifies finding, scheduling, and managing games
- **Friendly but neutral:** Conversational but not overly familiar - avoid direct address like "Hey, you need to find a partner"
- **Minimalistic:** Clean, uncluttered messaging - less is more

**What to Avoid:**
- Overly salesy or pushy language
- Technical jargon
- Direct second-person address that feels too familiar
- Exaggerated claims or hype
- Mentioning ATP Tour directly (the reference should be subtle)

**What to Include:**
- Real benefits that solve actual problems
- A sense of community and belonging
- The joy of playing more tennis
- Practical simplicity
- Gentle humor where appropriate

3. **Key Features:** Highlight 3-4 main benefits/features
4. **Game Types:** Explain match types and training options
5. **Final CTA:** Gentle invitation to join
