## 1. Hero

- **Headline:** “Schedule tennis without the group chat”
- **Subheadline:** “Set your courts, time windows, and player level. Share a link so partners pick the slot that works.”
- **Primary CTA (button):** “Create a session”
- **Secondary CTA (button):** “Browse public sessions”
- **Supporting microcopy:** “No login needed to view public events.”

## 2. How It Works

Short intro: “A quick flow built for real players.”

1. **Set the session** – Choose format (singles, training, doubles), locations, time windows, player count, and NTRP range.
2. **Share the link** – Send it to friends or keep it discoverable for nearby players.
3. **Review requests** – See who matches your slots and confirm the lineup.
4. **Sync & play** – Everyone receives the details and you can push it to Google Calendar.

## 3. Key Features

- **Easy coordination** – Manage time windows, preferred courts, and flexible player counts in minutes.
- **Partner matching** – NTRP filters and join requests keep skill levels predictable before you say yes.
- **Calendar integration** – Optional Google Calendar sync blocks conflicts and nudges reminders.
- **Share anywhere** – A single link works for chats, clubs, or public discovery pages.

## 5. Final CTA Section
